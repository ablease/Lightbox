###Secure Chat for Doctors

Our challenge for the 2 week final project at Makers Academy is to develop
a chat app specifically for use by Doctors.

#The Problem

As a Medical Professional, attaining a second opinion for a patient is a length
and expensive process. Patient data may only be viewed by medical staff
outside of the patients case under a myriad of rules and regulations. 

Traditionally a doctor may meet with another doctor in a private face-to-face
environment to discuss patient cases. At this meeting a Caldicott Guardian
must be present and various legal documents signed to ensure patient data
security. 

### Questions to Ask Tomorrow

- Currently, what is the second opinion process, as a doctor who needs a second opinion
- What can be improved in the second opinion process, how would this app help?
- What problem needs to be solved? Why do you need to do this?
- What are the legal limitations of an electronic second opinion process?
- What information needs to be transfered between specialists?
- How regularly to you need to revisit cases?
- How do you know who to ask for a second opinion for a specific case?
- How do you approach doctors for a second opinion?
- Why would a specialist be motivated to give you a second opinion? Financial gain?
or is there a mandatory requirement for practising doctors?
- Would there be implications taking this app to a worldwide audience?

### Initial Research

Over the weekend,
- [Information comission](https://ico.org.uk/)
- [DGL](http://www.helixhealth.co.uk/products/dgl.181.html)
- [HCPC](http://www.hpc-uk.org/)
- Read up on patient date security
- Caldicott principals
- Data protection, in what context will it apply for our app?
- Brush up on technology covered so far in the course
- Come up with app name and branding
- Look at other apps for inspiration/features/design/improvments

### Technology
##### Research Options
Below are some technologies we researched for inspiration to this project.

- [chat servers](http://socket.io/get-started/chat/)
- [sinatra chat](https://blog.engineyard.com/2013/getting-started-with-ruby-and-websockets)
- [Caldicott](https://www.wcppe.org.uk/sites/default/files/file/NES/CaldicottPrinciples-DataProtectionAct.pdf)
- [Cramp](https://github.com/lifo/cramp)

##### Experimenting

Before we decided on a stack of technology to use to build this project, we experimented with a few options
- Socket.io and Node.js + Express.js
It was quick and relativly simple to setup a basic chat server using Socket.io.

- Cramp and sinatra
Having used sinatra extensively for previous projects, these technologies felt familiar
and easy to use, and with our current skill set easily expandible into other features. 

### User Story Discussion

We held a discussion to describe the type of stakeholders in our app and came to the
following conclusions
- Doctor who needs a second opinion
- Doctor who wants to give a second opinion
- Patient
- System Administrator

We then describe use cases of each stakeholder and outlined our workflow using pivitol tracker
